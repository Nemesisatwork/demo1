Everyone around you has different things to tell about you, but only you know your true self. There are billions of people on this planet, and every person has a different purpose. Each person finds their mission differently and has a different journey. Thus, when I write about myself, I write about my journey and what makes the person I am because of the trip. I try to be myself, be passionate about my dreams and hobbies, live honestly, and work hard to achieve all that I want to make.<br><br>I am a student who lives in Guwahati with my family. My father is originally from Tripura whereas my Mom is from Assam.<br><br>Currently I am pursuing my B. Tech from <b>Sikkim Manipal Institute of Technology</b> which is located in Sikkim.<br><br>Sikim is a beautiful place. There is greenry everyehere.
